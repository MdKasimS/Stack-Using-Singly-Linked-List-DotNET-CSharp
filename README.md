# Stack-Using-Singly-Linked-List-DotNET-CSharp

This is a Stack data structure using Singly Linked List. Logic behind creation of Nodes and forming SLL is same as it was used in my earlier published repo https://github.com/MdKasimS/Singly-Linked-List-Using-DotNET-CSharp.
This is means methods of stack like
1. Push
2. Pop
3. Size
4. Print
5. Is Empty
are newly added.
The stack implemented using purely "SinglyLinkedList.cs" is here : [Coming Soon].

This is a menu driven simple console Dotnet application that fills and empties stack data structure.

What it is and how it is? A DSA named namespace is created which have SLLNode and StackSLL public classes. This is to maintain all DSA related classes used in several data structure implementations.

How to run this project? This repo can be cloned and run using "dotnet run" command on CMD.
